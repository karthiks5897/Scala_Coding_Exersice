To create a matching engine for FX orders in Scala, you can follow these steps:

1. Read Orders from CSV File:
   - Read the CSV file (exampleOrders.csv) containing orders for the USD/GBP currency pair.
   - Create a data structure to hold each order, including order ID, user name, order time, order type, quantity, and price.

2. Initialize Data Structures:
   - Create data structures to represent an "order book" for both BUY and SELL orders. The order book should maintain the orders based on their type and price.

3. Order Matching:
   - Iterate through the orders one by one, in the order they were placed (based on the order time).
   - Check the type of the current order (BUY or SELL).
   
4. Matching BUY Orders (BUY-side Matching):
   - If it's a BUY order, check the SELL order book to find a matching SELL order with the same quantity.
   - If a matching SELL order is found, record the match details (IDs of both orders, price, quantity, and match time) and remove the matched SELL order from the order book.
   - If no matching SELL order is found, add the BUY order to the BUY order book.

5. Matching SELL Orders (SELL-side Matching):
   - If it's a SELL order, check the BUY order book to find a matching BUY order with the same quantity.
   - If a matching BUY order is found, record the match details (IDs of both orders, price, quantity, and match time) and remove the matched BUY order from the order book.
   - If no matching BUY order is found, add the SELL order to the SELL order book.

6. Match Price Priority:
   - When multiple orders match with the same price, ensure that the first order that arrived is used for the match. This maintains order priority.

7. Write Match Details to Output CSV:
   - As matches occur, record the match details (BUY and SELL order IDs, price, quantity, and match time).
   - Write the match details to an output CSV file (outputExampleMatches.csv).

8. Repeat for All Orders:
   - Continue this process for all orders in the CSV file, ensuring that orders are processed in chronological order based on their order time.

9. Close Matched Orders:
   - Once orders are matched, they should be closed, meaning they are no longer available for further matching.
